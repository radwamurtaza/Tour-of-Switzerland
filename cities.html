<dt><h1> &nbsp; <font style="text-decoration: underline">Bern </font></h1>
<h2>

<dd>Not many cities have managed to retain their historic <br>features quite as successfully as Bern, the capital of <br> Switzerland. The old town of Bern is a UNESCO World <br>Heritage Site and thanks to its 6 kilometres of <br>arcades - the locals refer to them as 'Lauben' - boasts on of <br>the longest weather-sheltered shopping promenades <br>in Europe.
<br><br>

Bern is the seat of Switzerland's government. The Houses<br> of Parliament (Bundeshaus) rise above the city just <br> a stone's throw away from the railway station. The doors to<br> the Houses of Parliament are open to visitors most of <br> the time, and if you're lucky you might even bump <br>into a member of parliament in the streets of <br>the city. 
<br><br>

Set in the heart of Switzerland, Bern is the gateway<br> to the Alps. The capital city may easily be reached by <br>car or by air via the Bern-Belp Airport and<br> bus links to the city centre. Visitors who<br> prefer to travel by train may take advantage of <br>the dense rail network with its direct connections to the <br>major European cities. Bern’s central location makes it the<br> perfect base for overnight accommodation and for <br>excursions throughout Switzerland.

<dt><h1> &nbsp; <font style="text-decoration: underline">Zurich </font></h1>
<h2>
<img src="zurich-day.jpg" width="45%" heigth="30% style="align="right"" border="5">
<dd>The cosmopolitan city by the water combines creative <br> urban life with nature in all its glory. Zurich is abuzz with <br> activity day and night with its countless events, diverse <br> museums, own food festival and Switzerland’s most vibrant <br> nightlife. And if you’re after rest and relaxation, you <br> can be in the Swiss mountains in less than an hour.  
<br><br>

Zurich is Switzerland’s centre of economic life and education. <br> Located in the heart of Europe, the city offers all the modern<br> amenities of a cosmopolitan metropolis, without sacrificing its <br> natural side. Zurich has for years ranked among the <br> world’s top cities in terms of quality of life. It is a boutique <br>city that offers everything that implies, albeit in small <br>and exquisite format.
<br><br>

The city’s rustic pubs, street food festivals and pop-up <br> restaurants in empty factories are also enjoying a great degree <br>of popularity. All the city’s culinary offerings – <br>and a lot more besides – can be sampled by the way at the <br> annual FOOD ZURICH festival. Zurich is the perfect <br>destination for winter fans: numerous ski regions in the <br>immediate vicinity invite visitors to ski, toboggan,<br> or ice skate, while in the city itself there is a huge choice <br>of top-level cuisine and cultural activities.

<dt><h1> &nbsp; <font style="text-decoration: underline">Geneva </font></h1>
<h2>
<img src="geneva.jpeg" width="45%" heigth="70% style="align="right"" border="5">
<dd>Geneva is Switzerland’s most international city, as it is where the European seat of the UNO is based. Even the International Red Cross directs its humanitarian campaigns from here. <br> Besides being a congress city, Geneva is also a centre for culture and history, for trade fairs and exhibitions. The «Horloge Fleuri», the large flower clock in the “Jardin Anglais” <br> (English Garden), is a world-renowned symbol of the Geneva watch industry. 
<br><br>

Culturally, this city on the westernmost fringe of <br> Switzerland has much to offer. International artists perform <br> in the Grand Théâtre and Geneva Opera House, and <br>an extremely diverse range of museums such as the <br> “Musée international de l'horlogerie”, a watch museum with
<img src="geneva-night.jpg" width="45%" heigth="70% style="align="right"" border="5">
<br> a collection of jewellery watches and musical clocks, and <br> the International Museum of the Red Cross <br> and Red Crescent, which provides an insight into the work of<br> these humanitarian organisations, invite city guests to visit them. 

<br><br>
A rewarding excursion destination is Mont Salève, which <br> is situated in neighboring France. The cableway lifts <br> visitors to an altitude of 1100 metres in less than five <br> minutes, giving rise to outstanding vistas across the <br> city of Geneva, Lake Geneva, the chain of Alps, the Jura <br> and Montblanc. Geneva lies idyllically between Alpine <br> peaks and vineyards by the largest lake in Western Europe.

<dt><h1> &nbsp; <font style="text-decoration: underline">Basel </font></h1>
<h2>
<img src="basel.jpeg" width="45%" heigth="70% style="align="right"" border="5">
<dd>Basel is Switzerland's oldest university city. Historic <br> landmarks of the city include the large market square with<br> its richly decorated red sandstone town hall and the <br>late Romanesque-Gothic cathedral. During a walk<br> through the old town, past small boutiques, antique<br> book shops but also shops of modern designers, a <br>visit to the "Läckerli Huus" to try the<br> traditional Basel honey cake is well worth your while.
<br><br>
Basel’s citizens love art. In 1967 they voted to buy <br>some Picasso paintings, when the famous Spaniard found <br>out, he was so touched that he donated three <br>of his works to the city, cost-free. This tells you all <br>you need to know about the Baslers and their love of culture,<br> which is on display in the city’s many art museums. The city<br> also hosts Art Basel, the world’s premier<br> art exhibition.

<br><br>
Basel is tradition-conscious and open-minded at the same time, <br> a fact born out by several modern buildings designed by <br>renowned architects such as Herzog & de Meuron, <br>Mario Botta, Diener & Diener and Richard Meyer. Basel is a <br>green city. The Botanical Gardens, several parks and <br>the banks of the Rhine are perfect places to relax and<br> linger for a while. And the Etoscha <br>House at the zoo offers spectacular insights into the <br> Namibian Savannah.
